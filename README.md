# Zucchini Windows x64 builds
This repository is for building [Zucchini](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/components/zucchini/) for Windows x64.

Zucchini is a binary diffing and patching tool, and it is one of the components in the Chromium codebase. It is primarily used to create smaller software updates by generating patches between two binary files.

This build script is based on https://github.com/xarantolus/subresource_filter_tools scripts.
